Embedding Accessibility into California's Apprenticeship Infrastructure: A Digital Workflow Solution for Intermediaries
In this interactive workshop participants will beta test an AI-powered digital tool designed to systematically integrate accessibility analysis into apprenticeship program development workflows. Participants will experience how intermediaries can support employers in creating inclusive work process schedules that take accessibility considerations into account. The session demonstrates how accessibility can become a standard part of program development infrastructure rather than an afterthought, This approach shows how intermediaries can scale inclusive practices across their entire portfolios instead of addressing accessibility program-by-program, and positioning intermediaries as accessibility expertise hubs within California's evolving apprenticeship ecosystem.
The session begins with context on how intermediaries can serve as accessibility expertise hubs, followed by a live demonstration of the tool using a real case study of employer consultation. Participants then engage in hands-on practice mapping the tool into their current workflows through role-based small groups, before discussing broader systems integration possibilities and providing feedback for tool refinement. The session emphasizes how accessibility can become standard infrastructure rather than an add-on compliance activity.
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:
1. Recognize how accessibility can be embedded into intermediary workflows.
2. Experience hands-on use of AI-powered analysis to identify accessibility barriers in work process schedules.
3. Understand how Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles and regulatory requirements can inform systematic approaches to creating accessible apprenticeship programs across multiple occupations and employers.
4. Identify integration opportunities within their own organizations
