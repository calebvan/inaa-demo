Notes on the Inclusive Work Process Resource
Meeting notes: 5/23/25
What is currently missing
Accessibility Technology Guidelines: While the document mentions accessibility, it may benefit from a dedicated section on assistive technology recommendations and digital accessibility requirements for apprenticeship programs. This could include specifics about screen reader compatibility, captioning for video content, and keyboard-navigable interfaces.
Trauma-Informed Mentorship Approach: You may consider adding guidance on trauma-informed mentorship practices. Many individuals with disabilities have experienced barriers and rejection in previous educational or employment settings. Mentors trained in trauma-informed approaches can better support apprentices through challenges.
Success Metrics Beyond Compliance: The document references the 7% utilization goal, but may benefit from suggesting specific KPIs that organizations could track to measure inclusion success beyond compliance (e.g., retention rates, promotion rates, satisfaction surveys specific to accessibility).
Psychological Safety Framework: Building on my earlier recommendations about disclosure fears, a framework for creating psychologically safe environments may strengthen the document. This could include specific conversation guides for supervisors and practical examples of inclusive behaviors.
Peer Support Networks: You may consider recommending the establishment of peer support networks or communities of practice among apprentices with disabilities. These networks can provide invaluable support while reducing isolation.
Accommodation Request Process: The document may benefit from a template or flow chart outlining a clear, supportive accommodation request process that respects privacy while ensuring needs are met.
Funding Gap Identification: I noticed the funding section is comprehensive, but it may be helpful to acknowledge potential funding gaps and creative solutions for smaller organizations.
Competency-Based Assessment Alternatives: While mentioned briefly, expanding on alternative assessment methods for demonstrating competency could potentially better serve diverse learning styles and abilities.
Next Steps
Orrian will connect me to Cindy (DAS person who provided above recs), Robert Fried and Sabrina Kansara about working together on this issue
As a group we might decide to Build out this tool to be more comprehensive
Consider best use/ efficient practice for how something like this could be developed and integrated into DAS registration process and work in practice

A Conversation with Michael Figuccio on 7/31/2025
Meeting context setting:
I am looking to build a tool to support AI-powered digital tool designed to 
systematically integrate accessibility analysis into apprenticeship program development workflows. 
experience how intermediaries can support employers in creating inclusive work process schedules that take accessibility considerations into account.
how accessibility can become a standard part of program development infrastructure rather than an afterthought, 
how intermediaries can scale inclusive practices across their entire portfolios instead of addressing accessibility program-by-program, and 
positioning intermediaries as accessibility expertise hubs within California's evolving apprenticeship ecosystem.

Michael has developed a training program for direct support professionals (DSPs) in New York that provides micro-credentials for program participants and builds pathways for workers into better-paying jobs in the industry: . Michael has designed the program so that it is accessible for people with disabilities, in particular neurodivergent participants. His program illustrates some of the accessibility considerations and issues that an accessible apprenticeship program designer may need to consider.
Meeting discussion notes with Michael
Can you describe your program elements that support inclusivity/accessibility? 
The first step is to have a really good intake – you need to know about folks to make it person-centered. 
What are they comfortable doing
Their goals,
What do they think they can do
What supports can we provide to ensure we’re successful
Types of questions for the intake – semi-structured
Tell me about yourself; schooling and aspects of schooling you like best
Why is DSP a good fit
Have you been supported by DSP; what worked and didn’t work
Your strengths and limitations; what’s a dealbreaker
Intakes are budgeted for 90 minutes
Then, find a good provider – some are invested and some are just looking for numbers
Partner with a handful of providers who are a good fit
Have the providers do their own interview 1-1
Tell them about your expectations and have open communication
After that, Michael will then meet with both
How did it go – is it a good fit; is it symbiotic;
What are your concerns (and we mediate)
Then we monitor with regular check-ins
Job coach does this. Job coach comes right before or after class to address soft skills and trouble shoot
Apprentices take 1 course at a time so they meet weekly with a thoughtfully selected professor
How’s it going currently for Michael’s program?
Placements are taking longer than he thought (and more resources)
It’s on both sides – we want to make sure the fit is really right
We coordinate academic coach, job coach and professor
We’re also limited by geography cuz worksites are not on public transit and apprentices don’t drive
We have grant funding to support transportation
Did you do anything for your schedule A?
Conversations with OPWDD and SUNY and Commonpoint (partner) ahead of time that we were going to do this
We didn’t make major changes
time of courses adjusted to having back-to-back courses rather than concurrent courses. Which doubles the program completion time
A typical cohort has 4%-8% of participants self-report a disability, but a lot of folks also say “prefer not to state.” Still, everyone in the program has an academic coach as part of this grant. Without that, there’d be a lot more attrition I think.
Could OPWWD or partners do things to help?
The application process is cumbersome. Thre’s 3 levels of registration
Apply as nonmatriculated student
Then ETREVE application that assigns curric
Then old school paper form
So there’s lots of steps for them to drop off.
A phone bank support system would help for regional students. (phone because chat doesn’t work for some students or there’s tech limitations.)
We’ve been approached about replicating the process for prevention, and Child Development Credentials. We’ve also thought about extending this to Para’s. 
The support coach though is just really key and available 24 hours.
